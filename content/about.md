Hello! my name is Andrés I'm from Arequipa-Perú, I'm an Industrial Engineer with a specialization in Data Science and my favorite tool is R, mostly because of its friendly and supportive community, so I have made this blog to share my personal, data projects with the data science community.

Posts here are going to have a broad variety of topics but all are going to be data-driven, I hope you enjoy reading my posts and find them useful.
